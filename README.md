# InColorApp

This project was a group project within the Mobile Application Development (iOS) course at Indiana University. We were tasked with creating an application that was unique to topics we learned in class and to utilize 3 frameworks. I created this app with 2 other peers, Eli Cohen and Jacob Day. Together we created a simple drawing app that was entirely functional on iPhone and iPad. Users are able to draw freely, trace over a background image, change colors of brush or background, and save canvases locally on their device.
